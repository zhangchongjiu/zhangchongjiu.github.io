I am Zhang, Chong-Jiu (張重玖), a Ph.D. student in Sociology at the University of Wisconsin--Madison. I received my bachelor's from Southwestern University of Finance and Economics in Chengdu, China, and my master's from Beijing Normal University in Beijing, China. 

My research centers on social stratification, particularly in relation to education, social demography, and cultural and historical change. I study how inequalities are produced, reproduced, and rationalized through both material structures and symbolic forms. Methodologically, I use quantitative, experimental, and computational approaches, drawing on survey, census, experimental, and textual data.


### Research Interests
- Inequality and social stratification
- Education
- Population and family dynamics
- Culture, taste, and historical change
