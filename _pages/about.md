I am Zhang, Chong-Jiu (重玖), a Ph.D. student in Sociology at the University of Wisconsin--Madison. I received my bachelor's degree from Southwestern University of Finance and Economics (SWUFE) in Chengdu, China, and my master's degree from Beijing Normal University in Beijing, China. 

Most of my previous research projects focus on (1) the causes and consequences of educational inequalities and (2) social demography in post-reform China, with a primary focus on male-skewed sex ratio imbalances. I mainly apply quantitative methods along with survey and census data.
