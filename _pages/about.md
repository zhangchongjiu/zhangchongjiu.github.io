I am Zhang, Chong-Jiu (張重玖), a Ph.D. student in Sociology at the University of Wisconsin--Madison. I received my bachelor's from Southwestern University of Finance and Economics in Chengdu, China, and my master's from Beijing Normal University in Beijing, China. 

My research centers on inequality and social stratification, which I approach through multiple substantive domains including education, culture, and demographic change. Broadly, I study how inequalities are produced, reproduced, and rationalized--both through material structures and symbolic forms. Methodologically, I draw on quantitative, experimental, and computational approaches, combining survey, census, experiment, and textual data.
