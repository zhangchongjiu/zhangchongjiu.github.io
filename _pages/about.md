I am ZHANG, Chongjiu, a graduate student at the Institure for Economics of Education, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China. I received my bachelor's degree from Southwestern University of Finance and Economics (SWUFE), Chengdu, China, 2020. 

Most of my previous research projects focus on (1) the causes and consequences of educational inequalities and (2) social demography in post-reform China, with a primary focus on male-skewed sex ratio imbalances. I mainly apply quantitative methods along with survey and census data.


### Research Interests
