### Zhang:
"Zhang" is my surname and is pronounced like "J-ah-ng" in English.
 - The "zh" sounds like the "j" in "job."
 - The "a" sounds like the "a" in "father."
 - The "ng" sounds like the "ng" in "sing."

### Chongjiu:
"Chongjiu" is my given name and consists of two syllables, "Chong" and "Jiu."

"Chong" is pronounced like "ch-aw-ng" in English.
 - The "ch" sounds like the "ch" in "chair."
 - The "o" sounds like the "aw" in "saw."
